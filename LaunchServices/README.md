# Omega LaunchServices

This folder contains many interfaces for different programming languages for the Omega LaunchServices API. This API is used for launching application bundles, handling URIs and opening files.

This does not aim to implement the LaunchServices that are part of Apple's Core Framework, it merely uses the same name because it provides a similar function: launching apps.

So don't expect any compatibility with the Apple API.

The same goes for our app bundles, these are not meant to be compatible with those of Apple, they merely serve the same purpose, to bundle an app alongside all of its dependencies.
