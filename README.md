# The OMEGA Platform and Developer API

This repository is full of convenience APIs for Oslo OS applications. Some are used for common backend tasks, like launching apps and writing persistent application data. Others help with developing apps that conform to Oslo's design guidelines, for making your app blend in and look good.

- Oui is the Oslo User Interface platform, for writing apps easily that fit the user interface guidelines.
- LaunchServices is used for starting apps, opening files in the default program, and other common tasks related to launching apps and dealing with files.
- SettingsAPI is used to write persistent app storage, and when used in conjunction with the Settings Schema API, can put your app's settings in the Settings app, where they blend in with Oslo app settings. You can save things like game data and anything your app needs to remember here too.

*This is part of the Arbyon project, the project backing Oslo OS. You can see more of what we do at <https://arbyon.com>. If that website is down, try <https://github.com/Arbyon-OsloOS>.*
